Changes :

1. Added more comments for clarity for : 
	1. Creating new variables
	2. Manipulating data

2. Changed code width out code better to accomodate margin-80. 

3. Removed text showing next to plots

4. Changed markdown global parameters (although there is block-wise local , echo = FALSE , they don't *technically* OVERRIDE global parameters - since they are one and the same).

5. Removed most bi-variate plots from Uni-variate plots section. I've kept some(if the plots themselves are bi-variate) but the explanation is from Uni-variate aspect of it. i.e If I had used 'fill' parameter and have not explained the 'fill' aspect of it - I've kept the plots in Uni-variate section itself , since , the fill is only for me to get insights (and I haven't explained anything from the optional second parameter).

6. Removed unneccessary duplicate plots.

7. Changed plots fill and color scale to 'sequential' where neccessary (if the fill parameter has >6 values , even if sequential filling is applicable , I've ignored , because the difference is not as apparent. I've used this to explain variance in 'alpha' rating , however!)

8. Added transparency in places neccessary.

9. Changed 'stacked' to 'dodge' when explain variance within categories. Kept stacked for explaining parts to whole ratio!

10. Changed few histogram to frequency polygon for easier interpretability.

11. Avoided using new plot in 'final plots section!'

12. Removed n parameter for final plots and decided to do Multi-variate plots with 3 parameters only. I had only kept 'n' parameter in the first place to show scale of effect(i.e see how the points have clustered favoring a particular observation , but I didn't really want to explore this aspect!)

13. Added proper scales (in USD , in % etc. ) to final plots.


Stuff to be done (Optional rubrics) : 

1. Verify statistically if the point indeed are diff. --> perform ANOVA.
2. Add future challenges.
